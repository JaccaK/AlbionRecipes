# Plans
* Vue Rewrite

I just really liked how clean some table components looked, and how useful v-model was. I don't really know any frontend, this entire website is hobbled together by Jquery and hope.

Any additional calcs will be on hold once I try to figure out Vue. It can't be that hard, most of the stuff is already pretty much thought out for me with other libraries.
