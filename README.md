# Plans
I plan to update this in the coming weeks and also release tools to help speed up localization. So far I have made two JSON parsers to help speed the process of updating the site. As of right now, I only have an updated names.js to show for it. I plan to release the parsers, but one is quite literally 2 lines of code.
Finally, I will be adapting the webpages and adt.js to allow for East support, but as of this moment is only supports West with pre-mists items.
