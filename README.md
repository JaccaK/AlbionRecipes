# Plans
I plan to update this in the coming weeks. So far I have made two parsers to help speed the process of updating the site. You can find them here: https://github.com/JaccaK/AlbionRecipesParsers . I have also updated most of the calculators.

#### TODO
* Localization, of at least the item names. They're all in the formatted/items.json file, just waiting to be used, I just need a better item class setup to abuse polymorphism concepts to avoid doing work.
* Refining. Right now Refining is missing x.4 items and enchanted stone recipes.
* T1, T2, T3 items. I don't think these are in the request url strings, so they currently don't have Albion Online Data Project data.
* Farm is missing the owl seeds from Brecilien rep, but so is the wiki, so it's at the bottom of the update list.
