Albion Recipes is an automatic crafting profit calculator utilizing The Albion Online Data Project. We're not associated or endorsed by Albion Online, Sandbox Interactive GmbH, or The Albion Online Data Project. Their respective trademarks belong to them. blah blah blah legal handwavy stuff that probably doesn't actually mean anything.


# Plans
I plan to update this in the coming weeks. So far I have made two parsers to help speed the process of updating the site. You can find them here: https://github.com/JaccaK/AlbionRecipesParsers . I have also updated most of the calculators.

#### TODO
* Add handlers for the server select so that it automatically starts the update process.
* Add handlers to language select so it rebuilds the table with the correct item names.
* T1, T2, T3 items. I don't think these are in the request url strings, so they currently don't have Albion Online Data Project data.
* Farm is missing the owl seeds from Brecilien rep, but so is the wiki, so it's at the bottom of the update list.
